## Schema

### Required

- `folder_id` (String) The UUID of the Passbolt folder to be shared. This folder must already exist.
- `group_name` (String) The name of the Passbolt group to grant access to. The group must already exist.
- `permission` (String) Level of access to grant. Must be one of: `read`, `update`, `owner`, or `delete`.
	- `read`: read-only access
	- `update`: ability to edit contents
	- `owner`: full control (admin rights)
	- `delete`: used internally to revoke permissions (not typically used manually)

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Internal resource ID, always in the format `folder_id:group_name`. Used to uniquely track the sharing link between a folder and a group.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Folder permission can be imported using folder_id:group_name
terraform import passbolt_folder_permission.example 1111aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333-cccc4444dddd:DevOps
